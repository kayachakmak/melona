    Due to his busy international work schedule and residence abroad, the patient’s primary expectation was to complete the treatment without experiencing a toothless period and to return home with fixed teeth on the same day.

    After comprehensive clinical and radiological evaluation, a complete implant revision and full-arch rehabilitation was planned.

    ⸻

    🏥 Treatment Protocol
        •	Atraumatic removal of the existing 15-year-old implants
        •	Placement of 12 dental implants in the upper and lower jaws
        •	Sinus lifting procedure performed in the same surgical session
        •	Application of 2 cc bone graft supported with a resorbable membrane
        •	Use of Italian-made dental implants with advanced surface technology
        •	Achieving high primary stability, allowing for immediate loading

    ⸻

    ⏱️ Immediate Fixed Temporary Restoration

    One of the most critical aspects of this treatment was ensuring the patient never remained without teeth.

    ✔️ Digital impressions were taken on the day of surgery
    ✔️ Fixed temporary prostheses were delivered on the same day
    ✔️ The patient returned to his home country with functional and aesthetic fixed teeth

    This approach allowed the patient to continue his daily life and business activities without interruption.

Case Study: Full-Mouth All-on-6 Rehabilitation in a Young Patient with Advanced Periodontitis

(Upper & Lower Jaw – Titanium Bar Supported)

Key Finding
	•	Teeth appeared relatively healthy in clinical photographs
	•	Radiographic examination revealed advanced periodontitis and severe bone loss
	•	Poor long-term prognosis despite young age

⸻

🦷 Patient Presentation

The patient, despite being young, presented a striking clinical situation.
At first glance, the anterior teeth appeared relatively healthy, which could easily be misleading in a purely visual examination.

However, radiographic (X-ray) evaluation revealed:
	•	Advanced-stage periodontitis
	•	Severe vertical and horizontal bone loss
	•	Compromised support of all remaining teeth

Due to the extent of periodontal destruction, none of the teeth had a predictable long-term prognosis.

⸻

🎯 Treatment Objectives
	•	Eliminate active periodontal infection
	•	Prevent further bone loss
	•	Restore full oral function
	•	Provide a fixed, stable and long-term solution
	•	Achieve natural-looking esthetics despite extensive treatment

⸻

🏥 Treatment Protocol

A comprehensive full-mouth rehabilitation was planned and performed.

✔️ All teeth were extracted due to advanced periodontal disease
✔️ A total of 12 implants were placed
✔️ All-on-6 concept was applied for both the upper and lower jaws
✔️ Both arches were restored with titanium bar–supported fixed prostheses
✔️ Occlusion, phonetics and esthetics were carefully designed

Using titanium bar support ensured:
	•	Maximum strength and load distribution
	•	Long-term biomechanical stability
	•	High precision and durability

⸻

✨ Outcome
	•	Complete elimination of periodontal infection
	•	Stable, fixed full-arch restorations
	•	Excellent chewing efficiency
	•	Balanced bite and improved facial support
	•	Natural and confident smile
	•	Significant improvement in quality of life

The patient achieved a functional, secure and esthetically pleasing full-mouth rehabilitation, transforming both oral health and confidence.

⸻

🩺 Clinical Perspective

This case highlights an essential clinical message:

Healthy-looking teeth do not always mean healthy supporting tissues.

Radiographic evaluation plays a critical role in diagnosing silent but aggressive periodontitis, especially in young patients.

The All-on-6 concept with titanium bar support, when correctly indicated, provides a predictable and life-changing solution even in complex, advanced cases.

Case Study: Immediate Implant Placement & Loading in Advanced Periodontitis

🦷 Patient Condition

The patient presented with advanced-stage periodontitis, resulting in severely compromised natural teeth with poor long-term prognosis.
Due to active infection and extensive periodontal destruction, preserving the existing teeth was not a predictable option.

⸻

⸻

🏥 Treatment Protocol

✔️ All remaining teeth were extracted due to advanced periodontitis
✔️ Implants were placed on the same day as extractions
✔️ Immediate loading protocol was applied
✔️ Fixed temporary teeth were delivered the next day
✔️ After a 3-month healing and osseointegration period,
  final implant-supported zirconia restorations were completed

This approach allowed the patient to avoid a toothless period and regain confidence immediately.

⸻

✨ Outcome
	•	Elimination of periodontal infection
	•	Stable and fixed teeth from day one
	•	Restoration of chewing function and speech
	•	Healthy soft tissue healing
	•	Natural-looking, strong and durable zirconia restorations
